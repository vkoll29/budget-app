1. Work on the following console errors:
    (i) typeerror: cannot read property 'split' of undefined 
        thrown at line js:315
        happens when you click on DOM but not a particular item, on the income side
        this is because of event bubbling
    (ii)Cannot read property 'map' of undefined
        thrown at line js:75
        occurs mainly when you click on the expenses side 
    --- both of these errors occur because there is a click event assigned on the delete button but hardcoded
